# Redlining Coding Challenge

To complete this assignment:
  1. Clone this repository to your computer using GitHub Desktop or VSCode
  2. Open the repository in VSCode
  3. Complete the notebook(s)
  4. Use the GitHub tab in your Codespace to commit AND sync your changes

Your changes will then be available to the teaching team to look at.

Once you have finished the notebook(s):
    1. Create a new notebook in your portfolio repository
    2. Concisely duplicate your analysis in a location and time of your choosing (i.e. only include the code needed to generate the main plot you make)
    3. Add a headline and description discussing your results
    4. Convert your notebook to Markdown or HTML.
    5. Add a link to the live web version to the corresponding table in the class repository. You may also want to add a link to the home page of your portfolio!

The following code may help you to export your analysis:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert <your-notebook-name>.ipynb --to markdown --no-input
```

You can run it within your notebook as a `%%bash` cell, or in the terminal.
